# Federated Learning Simulations and Novel Clustered FL (Fedge)

This repository hosts comprehensive simulation frameworks and experimental implementations for a suite of Federated Learning (FL) algorithms. It includes established methods such as FedProx, pFedMe, FedNova, SCAFFOLD, FedAdam, as well as our novel clustered FL approach, Fedge.

Our work focuses on addressing the inherent challenges of federated environments, including data heterogeneity, communication constraints, and model personalization. 
Importantly, all methods are rigorously evaluated on multidimensional heterogeneity, where variations in data distribution in terms of label, quantity, feature and contrast, and network conditions are systematically incorporated.

This approach ensures a thorough assessment of robustness and scalability under realistic and complex scenarios.

This repository provides:

- Simulation Frameworks: Modular and reproducible implementations for evaluating FL methods under diverse experimental settings.
- Performance Metrics: Detailed analyses on convergence behavior, robustness to non-IID data distributions, communication efficiency, and resilience to multidimensional heterogeneity.
- Novel Contributions: Implementation and evaluation of Fedge, a clustered FL approach designed to enhance scalability and personalized model performance.

This resource aims to support researchers and practitioners in advancing robust, scalable, and privacy-preserving FL methodologies. Contributions and extensions are highly encouraged to further the state-of-the-art in federated learning research.
